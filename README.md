Analysis of Diabetes Patients Data

This repository contains an analysis of data related to diabetes patients. The data includes information about several variables that can potentially impact diabetes outcomes, including age, blood pressure, body mass index, and more.

## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to explore the data related to diabetes patients, conduct statistical analysis, and create visualizations to better understand the relationship between variables and how they impact diabetes outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It includes data from 768 female patients over the age of 21 years who have been diagnosed with diabetes. The dataset includes several variables such as age, blood pressure, body mass index, insulin level, and more.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The first step in the analysis was to perform exploratory data analysis to better understand the data. This involved examining the data for any missing values or outliers, checking for distribution of variables, and analyzing the relationships between different variables.

## Statistical Analysis
After completing exploratory data analysis, we conducted a statistical analysis of the data. This included performing hypothesis testing, calculating descriptive statistics, and conducting regression analysis. We also calculated the correlation between different variables and created correlation heatmaps to visually represent the relationships between variables.

## Visualizations
To better understand the relationships between different variables, we created several visualizations, including boxplots, heatmaps, pairplots, and scatterplots. These visualizations helped us identify the patterns and relationships between different variables and helped us understand the impact of each variable on diabetes outcomes.

## Conclusion
Overall, this analysis of diabetes patients data helped us gain a better understanding of the relationships between different variables and how they impact diabetes outcomes. We were able to identify patterns and relationships between different variables and create visualizations to better understand the data. This analysis can be useful for healthcare professionals and researchers looking to understand the factors that impact diabetes outcomes.
